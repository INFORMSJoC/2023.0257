`Simu_1` folder: to reproduce the results

Figure1.R and Figure2.R: to plot the results (Figure 1 and Figure 2) reproduced from `Simu_1` folder

Note: When running Figure1.R and Figure2.R to plot the figure, we need to change the path ("C:/Users/dell/Desktop") to the input data at the beginning of the code to the current desktop path of the reader. The rest of the path ("2023.0257/scr/output/...") remains unchanged.
