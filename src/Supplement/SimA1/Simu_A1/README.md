Other listed files are used in the main codes mentioned above:

- plma_kcv_lsM2_approximate_lambda_CV_all_Annals.m, CV_pl_Annals.m, and CV_pl_real.m are used for the proposed method
- pairwise_loss.m, pairwise_loss_real.m, pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_1.m, pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_2.m, pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_3.m, and pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_4.m are used to calculate ranking loss
- parfor_prograss.m is used for parallel program
- kcv_lsM2.m is used for the competing method proposed by Zhang and Liu (2023)
