To reproduce the results of Table 3 in the supplement, please run

- Table7_sim1_2.m, Table7_sim1_5.m, Table7_sim1_10.m, Table7_sim1_n2.m, Table7_sim1_op.m, Table7_sim2_2.m, Table7_sim2_5.m, Table7_sim2_10.m, Table7_sim2_n2.m, and Table7_sim2_op.m to store results of Table 3

Other listed files are used in the main codes mentioned above:

- plma_kcv_lsM2_approximate_lambda_CV_all_Annals.m, plma_kcv_linear_approximate_lambda_CV_all_Annals.m, CV_pl_Annals.m, CV_pl_real.m, CV_pl_sim2_linear_Annals.m, and CV_pl_sim2_linear_real.m are used for the proposed method
- pairwise_loss.m, pairwise_loss_real.m, pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_1.m, pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_2.m, pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_3.m, and pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_4.m are used to calculate ranking loss
- parfor_prograss.m is used for parallel program
- kcv_lsM2.m and kcv_nls_linear.m are used for the competing method proposed by Zhang and Liu (2022)
