`Simu_A5` folder: to reproduce the results

Figure5.R, Figure6.R and Figure7.R: to plot the results (Figure 5, Figure 6, and Figure7) reproduced from `Simu_A5` folder

Note: When running Figure5.R, Figure6.R, and Figure7.R to plot the figure, we need to change the path ("C:/Users/dell/Desktop") of the input data at the beginning of the code to the current desktop path of the reader. The rest of the path ("2023.0257/scr/output/...") remains unchanged.
