To reproduce the results of Figures 5 to 7 in the supplement, please run

- Figure5_Figure6_Figure7.m, Figure5_Figure6_Figure7_mix.m, normal_com.m, log_com.m, and SimA5_compare.m to store results of Figures 5 to 7 in the supplement

Other listed files are used in the main codes mentioned above:

- plma_kcv_mix_approximate_lambda_CV_all_Annals.m, CV_pl_mix_Annals.m, CV_pl_mix_real.m, plma_kcv_mix_approximate_lambda_CV_all_Annals_normal.m, CV_pl_mix_Annals_normal.m, CV_pl_mix_real_normal.m, plma_kcv_mix_approximate_lambda_CV_all_Annals_log.m, CV_pl_mix_Annals_log.m, and CV_pl_mix_real_log.m are used for the proposed method
- pairwise_loss.m, pairwise_loss_real.m, pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_1.m, pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_2.m, pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_3.m, and pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_4.m are used to calculate ranking loss
- parfor_prograss.m is used for parallel program
- kcv_mix.m, kcv_mix_normal.m, and kcv_mix_log.m are used for the competing method proposed by Zhang and Liu (2022)
