To reproduce the results of Figures 5 to 7 in the supplement, please run

- Figure5_Figure6_Figure7.m and Figure5_Figure6_Figure7_mix.m to store results of Figures 5 to 7 in the supplement

Other listed files are used in the main codes mentioned above:

- plma_kcv_mix_approximate_lambda_CV_all_Annals.m, CV_pl_mix_Annals.m, and CV_pl_mix_real.m are used for the proposed method
- pairwise_loss.m, pairwise_loss_real.m, pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_1.m, pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_2.m, pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_3.m, and pairwise_loss_approximate_Annals_4.m are used to calculate ranking loss
- parfor_prograss.m is used for parallel program
- order.R and screen.R are used for the proposed method to select appropriate genes 
- kcv_mix.m is used for the competing method proposed by Zhang and Liu (2022)
