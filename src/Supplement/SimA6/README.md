`Simu_A6` folder: to reproduce the results

Figure8.R, Figure9.R, Figure10.R, Figure11.R, Figure12.R, and Figure13.R: to plot the results (Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure10, Figure11, Figure12, and Figure13) reproduced from `Simu_A6` folder

Note: When running Figure8.R, Figure9.R, Figure10.R, Figure11.R, Figure12.R, and Figure13.R to plot the figure, we need to change the path ("C:/Users/dell/Desktop") of the input data at the beginning of the code to the current desktop path of the reader. The rest of the path ("2023.0257/scr/output/...") remains unchanged.
