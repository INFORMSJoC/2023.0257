`Simu_A7_10` folder and `Simu_A7_20` folder: to reproduce the results

Figure14.R and Figure15.R: to plot the results (Figure 14 and Figure 15) reproduced from `Simu_A7_10` folder and `Simu_A7_20` folder, respectively

Note: When running Figure14.R and Figure15.R to plot the figure, we need to change the path ("C:/Users/dell/Desktop") of the input data at the beginning of the code to the current desktop path of the reader. The rest of the path ("2023.0257/scr/output/...") remains unchanged.
